            "As I arrived at the Zion Paragliding base, a sense of excitement mingled with more than a touch of nerves. The professional pilots welcomed me warmly, and their reassurances put me at ease. They explained the process – how we would need to run off the edge of a cliff for takeoff. My heart raced as I listened, and I couldn't help but wonder what the experience would be like.",

I was literally about to follow my best friend off a cliff, having watched him confidently run straight off, dip from the weight on his paragliding wing before the wind current lofted him higher. It was only because of how easy and graceful he made it look - the other pilots in training had called him 'angel' more than once, that I was standing here, unable to back down.",

They seemed to know where the thermals were, those invisible pockets of rising warm air that paragliders use to gain altitude. We followed their lead, allowing the birds to show us the way. With each ascent, the landscape transformed beneath us, and we found ourselves soaring up into the clouds.",

The mountains gave way to the coastline, and the landing spot was the very same beach where I had run countless times during my stay in Dominical. The view from the sky was a revelation – the beach, the waves, the lush greenery – all transformed into a masterpiece painted by the gods themselves.",
